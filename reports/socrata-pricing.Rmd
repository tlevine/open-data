title: Open data about pricing of open data
---

Some governments were awesome enough to open data about the pricing
of the Socrata Open Data portal (XXX link).
I thought it would be interesting to figure out which plans different
Socrata clients were on and to see which features were most in demand.

## Pricing structure



## Data for the present analysis

These are related to the level (base, extended or enterprise)
of the Open Data Portal product.

* Number of datasets 
* Number of premium APIs

These are related to add-ons.

* Number of datasets with "311" in the title: This is a proxy for whether the 311 Explorer product is being used.
* Number of forms: I think this tells us whether DataCollect is being used and which at which level (basic, extended or enterprise)

## Acquiring the data


## Results

### Trends


### Guessing plans


### Validation
I've heard that four-fifths of Socrata's data are private,
so this is a very low estimate. It would nice to get some
idea as to how wrong this is.

Most of the documents I found about pricing are just price
lists, but two of them indicate specific proposed purchases.
One of them is a super-basic plan (more basic than `Soc-OD-B`)
for Sacramento, and Sacramento doesn't appear in the present data.
The other is for Hawaii, and that one does.

The plan for the Socrata Open Data Portal is called "Premium",
which is not one of the standard names; the price list just has
"Basic", "Extended", and "Enterprise". However, it seems to be
pretty close to the Basic plan.

* The price is about right. (The basic plan is usually a bit
    under $5,000.)
* The "delivery", which I presume means "bandwidth", is about
    right. (It's 1.25 TB, and the basic plan is 1 TB.)

My guesswork above suggests that Hawaii is on the extended plan,
but this document suggests that Hawaii is on something like the
basic plan. There are a few decent explanations for this.

* Hawaii did not end up making this particular purchase.
* Hawaii made this particular purchase, and it later increased its
    plan as it added more data.
* The "Premium" plan has all of these special features.
* I messed up somewhere.

My above guesswork also suggests that Hawaii has purchased
DataCollect, but I don't see DataCollect in the Hawaii document.

## Future research
I don't feel like I've done much here beyond pointing out that one
could look at the pricing of software. I really wanted to see what
features people have in their plans and which ones people wind up
using (like I did when looking at the use of [charting tools](/!/socrata-users)).

I also wanted to get some idea of what people wind up doing when
they're reaching the limits of their plans. At some point they'll
buy a new one, but do they wind up combining datasets in the meantime?
I'd need rather reliable knowledge about each client's plan in order
to do this.

I recently came across some documents about the pricing structure
of the Socrata Open Data portal (XXX link).
I thought it would be interesting to figure out which plans different
Socrata clients were on and to see which features were most in demand.

## Pricing structure



## Data for the present analysis

These are related to the level (base, extended or enterprise)
of the Open Data Portal product.

* Number of datasets 
* Proxies for the number of geocoding requests
  * Number of geospatial datasets
  * Total number of records across geospatial datasets
* Number of premium APIs

This one is related to add-ons

* Has a dataset with "311" in the title: This is a proxy for whether the 311 Explorer product is being used.
* Number of forms: This tells us whether DataCollect is being used and which at which level (basic, extended or enterprise)

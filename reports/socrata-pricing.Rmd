Some governments were awesome enough to open data about the pricing
of [Socrata](http://socrata.com) products.
[Here](https://github.com/tlevine/socrata-pricing) they are.

I thought it would be interesting to figure out which plans different
Socrata clients were on and to see which features were most in demand.

## Pricing structure
It looks like you're getting one packaged open data portal website from
Socrata, but it's sold as a bunch of different products. Also, the
Socrata Open Data Portal, even with all of its add-ons, is just the
beginning of Socrata's offerings.

### Socrata Open Data Portal
The main product that you hear about is the Socrata Open Data Portal.
There are three standard levels of service for this, and here are some
of their characteristics.

Basic (`Soc-OD-B`)

* 150 datasets
* 10 premium APIs
* Costs just under $5,000 per month

Extended (`Soc-OD-Ex`)

* 500 datasets
* 25 premium APIs
* Costs just under $10,000 per month

Enterprise (`Soc-OD-Ent`)

* 1,500 datasets
* 50 premium APIs
* Costs just under $15,000 per month

### Explorers
There are special "explorer" tools for these specific datasets.

* 311
* Checkbook
* Elections
* Health indicators

### DataCollect
DataCollect is "a cloud-based platform that simplifies the design, deployment, and management of intelligent data capture apps from authorized users".
It sounds like there's a lot more to DataCollect than I can see publically, but
I presume it has something to do with the
[form type](/!/open-by-default#popularity-of-forms)
on the open data portal.

Basic (`Soc-DC-B`)

* 5 data collection apps
* 50 active forms
* Costs just under $5,000 per month

Extended (`Soc-DC-Ex`)

* 10 data collection apps
* 100 active forms
* Costs just under $10,000 per month

Enterprise (`Soc-DC-Ent`)

* 20 data collection apps
* 500 active forms
* Costs just under $20,000 per month

### GovStat
[GovStat](http://socrata.com/govstat)
is a big product (in terms of cost) that I didn't look at.
I felt like it deserved its own section even though I'm not saying
much about it. It too has three levels of service

Basic (`Soc-GS-B`)

* 2 dashboards
* 20 goals
* 150 datasets
* Costs just under $7,500 per month

Extended (`Soc-GS-Ex`)

* 5 dashboards
* 100 goals
* 500 datasets
* Costs just under $15,000 per month

Enterprise (`Soc-GS-Ent`)

* 20 dashboards
* 400 goals
* 1,500 datasets
* Costs just under $30,000 per month

### And many others
There are a bunch of small things that I won't explain in much
detail, but you can read about them in the various price lists.

* ArcGIS Connect
* API Foundry
* Custom work
* Training

## Data for the present analysis
Today, I want to figure out which tier of Open Data Portal
service each client has purchased. With that in mind,
I collected four numbers ([variables](/!/variables)) for each data portal.

These two are related to the level (base, extended or enterprise)
of the Open Data Portal product.

* Number of datasets 
* Number of premium APIs

These two are related to other products.

* Number of datasets with "311" in the title: This is a proxy for whether the 311 Explorer product is being used.
* Number of forms: I think this tells us whether DataCollect is being used and which at which level (basic, extended or enterprise)

## Acquiring the data
I collected all of the data over the past week.
I downloaded lots of files,
put them into an SQLite3 database, and
then I ran the following
[queries](<%= root %>reports/socrata-pricing.sql).

To count **datasets**, I
[called the search API](<%= root %>download.py) and
[removed federation and derived views](/!/socrata-deduplicate).
I arrived at the number of [tables](/!/socrata-genealogies#term-table)
per data portal.

To count **APIs**, I
[went](<%= root %>apis.py)
to the following URL for each data portal.

    https://${catalog}/browse?limitTo=apis&utf8=%E2%9C%93

[Here](https://data.hawaii.gov/browse?limitTo=apis&utf8=%E2%9C%93)'s an example.

To count **311 datasets**, I just searched for datasets with "311" in their titles.

And to count **forms**, I just looked for datasets with a `displayType` of "form".

## Results

### Summary
This graph is pretty cool.

```{r fancy, echo = FALSE}
p.fancy
```

The x-axis tells us the number of datasets on a portal, the y-axis tells us the number
of special APIs, and the color tells us whether the portal contains any
[form views](/!/open-by-default#popularity-of-forms).
Most catalogs have no APIs, and these tend to also have few datasets; that's the cluster
at the bottom-left.

The three nested rectangles correspond to the three levels of service (basic, extended
and enterprise) in terms of the number of available datasets and APIs. This gets us to
my guess as to what plans people are on.

### Which plan?
Based only on the number of datasets and APIs, here are some rough guesses as to which
plans people are on. As I explain [below](#validation), these guesses are based only
on public data, so I think that they are low.

```{r plans, echo = FALSE, asis = TRUE}
kable(catalogs[c('data.portal.plan','has.311','data.collect.plan')])
```

### Number of forms
Note my choice to show the binary variable of whether any forms were on the portal
(more that zero) rather than showing the count of forms. I did this because no portals
had more than 50 publically visible forms, which is the threshold for jumping to
the extended plan (if I'm interpreting things correctly).

```{r forms, echo = FALSE}
p.forms
```

I think that the "Has form" variable tells us whether the client has purchased
at least the basic plan of DataCollect, and the number of forms doesn't tell us
much more about the product that the client has purchased.

### Validation
I've heard from Socrata employees that four-fifths of Socrata's data are private,
so this is a very low estimate. It would nice to get some
idea as to how wrong this is.

Most of the documents I found about pricing are just price
lists, but two of them indicate specific proposed purchases.
One of them is a super-basic plan (more basic than `Soc-OD-B`)
for Sacramento, and Sacramento doesn't appear in the present data.
The other is for Hawaii, and that one does.

![Picture of proposed purchases from Socrata by Hawaii](hawaii.png)

The plan for the Socrata Open Data Portal is called "Premium",
which is not one of the standard names; the price list just has
"Basic", "Extended", and "Enterprise". However, it seems to be
pretty close to the Basic plan.

* The price is about right. (The basic plan is usually a bit
    under $5,000.)
* The "delivery", which I presume means "bandwidth", is about
    right. (It's 1.25 TB, and the basic plan is 1 TB.)

My guesswork above suggests that Hawaii is on the extended plan,
but this document suggests that Hawaii is on something like the
basic plan. There are a few decent explanations for this.

* Hawaii did not end up making this particular purchase.
* Hawaii made this particular purchase, and it later increased its
    plan as it added more data.
* The "Premium" plan has all of these special features.
* I messed up somewhere.

My above guesswork also suggests that Hawaii has purchased
DataCollect, but I don't see DataCollect in the Hawaii document.

Hawaii has been hailed as a good example of government open data,
my hunch is that they wound up needing a bigger plan in order to
support their growing initiative.

## Future research
I don't feel like I've done much here beyond pointing out that one
could look at the pricing of software. I really wanted to see what
features people have in their plans and which ones people wind up
using (like I did when looking at the use of [charting tools](/!/socrata-users)).

I also wanted to get some idea of what people wind up doing when
they're reaching the limits of their plans. At some point they'll
buy a new one, but do they wind up combining datasets in the meantime?
I'd need rather reliable knowledge about each client's plan in order
to do this.

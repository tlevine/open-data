I thought it would be interesting to figure out which plans different
Socrata clients were on and to see which features were most in demand.

## Pricing structure



## Data for the present analysis

* Number of datasets
* Proxies for the number of geocoding requests
  * Number of geospatial datasets
  * Total number of records across geospatial datasets
* Number of premium APIs
* Has a dataset with "311" in the title (a proxy for the 311 explorer service)

## Acquiring the data

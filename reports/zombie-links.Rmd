After I wrote about
[dead links on data catalogs](/!/dead-links-on-data-catalogs),
some people commented that the links were less dead than I'd thought.


Some explanations were proposed.

**CKAN fails on HEAD requests**

**Redirects (Waldo)**

What was really going on?

## Status codes
I called a URL alive if an ordinary HEAD request to it returned a
[status code](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) of 200.
This simplifies things a little bit.

Here are all of the status codes that I received, from all of the different
links from all of the catalogs.

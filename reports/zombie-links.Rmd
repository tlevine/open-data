After I wrote about
[dead links on data catalogs](/!/dead-links-on-data-catalogs),
some people commented that the links were less dead than I'd thought.


Some explanations were proposed.

**CKAN fails on HEAD requests**

**Redirects (Waldo)**

What was really going on?

## Status codes
I called a URL alive if an ordinary HEAD request to it returned a
[status code](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) of 200.
This simplifies things a little bit.

Here are all of the status codes that I received, from all of the different
links from all of the catalogs.

```{r status_codes}
p.codes
```

Let's look at this plot for just the specific catalogs that those Tweets were
about.




It seems like there were a lot of timeouts,

```r
sort(table(subset(datasets, catalog == 'data.openva.com')$status_code), decreasing = T)[1:5]
```

```r
sort(table(subset(datasets, catalog == 'dati.trentino.it')$status_code), decreasing = T)[1:5]
```

but that doesn't fully explain the results in the chart from the other post.
It looks like I have duplicate records in the table.

    select catalog, identifier, count(*) from links where software = 'ckan' group by catalog, identifier order by count(*) desc limit 1;



I had thought that there was a unique index on
`links.software, links.catalog, links.identifier`,
but there wasn't!

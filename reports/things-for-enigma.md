## Public Records
I want contracts pertaining to the open data initiatives of different cities.
A place to start is searching for contracts and RFPs about the "open data"
initiative or related to any of the following organizations or products.

* Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF, OKFN)
  * Common knowledge archive network (CKAN)
* Socrata
  * Open Data Portal
  * Data Collect
  * GovStat
* Junar
* OpenDataSoft
* Accela
  * Open Data Platform

Other ideas nice stuff would be contact information for public records officers,

I'd love to get this from cities randomly sampled from the population of all
US cities, but we could also just start with cities with data catalogs or
cities in Sunlight's spreadsheet.

## Database access
Currently, most of the work in this analysis is in downloading data.
I would like to be able to run arbitrary code to reformat datasets without
having to download them all. It would be really cool if I could have something
equivalent to read-only access in whatever way the Enigma web application
accesses these data.
